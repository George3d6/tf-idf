    Term frequency[edit]
    Suppose we have a set of English text documents and wish to determine which document is most relevant to the query "the brown cow". A simple way to start out is by eliminating documents that do not contain all three words "the", "brown", and "cow", but this still leaves many documents. To further distinguish them, we might count the number of times each term occurs in each document and sum them all together; the number of times a term occurs in a document is called its term frequency.

    The first form of term weighting is due to Hans Peter Luhn (1957) and is based on the Luhn Assumption:

    The weight of a term that occurs in a document is simply proportional to the term frequency. [2]
    Inverse document frequency[edit]
    Because the term "the" is so common, term frequency will tend to incorrectly emphasize documents which happen to use the word "the" more frequently, without giving enough weight to the more meaningful terms "brown" and "cow". The term "the" is not a good keyword to distinguish relevant and non-relevant documents and terms, unlike the less common words "brown" and "cow". Hence an inverse document frequency factor is incorporated which diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely.

    Karen Spärck Jones (1972) conceived a statistical interpretation of term specificity called Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), which became a cornerstone of term weighting:

    The specificity of a term can be quantified as an inverse function of the number of documents in which it occurs. [3]
